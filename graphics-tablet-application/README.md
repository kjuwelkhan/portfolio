Project to embibe an ordinary laptop with graphics tablet functionality.

I started this project when I first became interested in art. I did not want to use paper and pencil, and to do digital art I deemed it necessary that I use a graphics tablet. Rather than burden my parents by asking for one, I remembered that an old computer of my father's was still lying around that had stylus functionality. It was, however, too weak and too old to run even windows x34, let alone a high powered vector based application such as Krita or Blender. After a bit of thinking, I decided that I could use its stylus capabilities if I could just facilitate the remote control of a more powerful computer via this. After yet more thinking, and a lot of searching for pre-existing applications that do this that this laptop could run, I decided that it would not be too difficult to create a simple client and server, and then track the mouse's location, store it in a string, and then use microsoft's inbuilt libraries to control the recieving laptop with the aforementioned string. Unfortunately while the interest in digital art did not last, I learned a lot from this experience, and felt proud at accomplishing such a useful task with a simple and efficient program.
