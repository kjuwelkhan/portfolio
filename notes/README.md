The following are notes that I wrote for myself while teaching myself mathematics at a university level. While I no longer want to be a tenured mathematician, the experience taught me a lot about thinking rigidly, logically, and providing sound arguments. It provided me my first taste of intellectual accomplishment, and mathematics will forever have a special place in my heart. Most of these works are from me following books (such as ireland and rosen's book, sheldon axler's book, and others) while there is a miscellanious document consisting entirely of my own work and own insights (though I do not claim them to be new).
