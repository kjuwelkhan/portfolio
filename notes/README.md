The following are notes that I wrote for myself while learning university level mathematics. Unfortunately, more of my notes have been deleted, along with the large majority of my coding work with a hard drive failure about a year ago. I have been unable to produce any new work due to the lack of free time afforded to me during the pandemic and academic schedule. Due to this, all that is available is old documents from Overleaf, except for a very recent document on Cayley's theorem, Yoneda's lemma, and functional programming.
