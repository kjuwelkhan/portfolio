Explanatory notes from university level mathematics textbooks, along with pdf of some of my own research.


The following are notes that I wrote for myself while teaching myself mathematics at a university level. While I no longer want to be a tenured mathematician, the experience taught me a lot about thinking logically, providing sound arguments, and constantly questioning assumptions to arrive at the truth. It also allowed for my first foray into philosophy. Its embuing me with my first taste of intellectual accomplishment will always be cause for me to remember it fondly.
